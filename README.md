Node.js / MongoDB
======

The goal of this Step by step tutorial is to get you started with developing basic to advanced applications, understanding their fundamental concepts and strictly following the best practices. The technology stack that weâ€™ll be using will be node (node.js) + express (Framework) + mongoDB (Database) all of which are popular, fast and highly scalable.

This step by step tutorial will be fairly in-depth so you may want to get yourself a rather large mug of whatever beverage you prefer before you settle down.
